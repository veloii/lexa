I love seeing new businesses focused on bringing quality organic foods to their communities, it's exactly what we're all about here. I've looked over your initial order request for $1,200 worth of our granola, nut butters, and dried fruit mixes and I'm bummed that I can't approve the 50% wholesale discount you're looking for. Our standard wholesale pricing is 35% off retail which would put your order at $780. I totally get that startup costs are brutal and every dollar counts when you're getting off the ground. What I can do is throw in free shipping on this first order and set you up with our new retailer payment terms so you'd have 30 days to pay instead of upfront. Plus once you hit $2,000 in orders over your first six months we can revisit pricing. Would love to support your venture and get Sunshine Organics on your shelves! Hit me back if you want to move forward or need to crunch numbers. Keep spreading the organic love! Tommy Rodriguez, Wholesale Manager, Sunshine Organics, tommy@sunshineorganics.net, 555-SUN-FOOD",

After reviewing your detailed requirements for the 4-tier vanilla and chocolate marble cake with fondant roses and gold leaf accents serving 150 guests, we must respectfully decline this order. Your requested budget of $350 is significantly below our pricing structure for custom wedding cakes of this complexity. A cake meeting your specifications would typically cost $850-$950. Our artisan decorating work and premium ingredients require this investment. We'd love to work within a revised budget or discuss simpler design alternatives. Perhaps a 3-tier design with buttercream instead of fondant details could fit your budget better. Please call 555-SWEET-1 to explore options.
