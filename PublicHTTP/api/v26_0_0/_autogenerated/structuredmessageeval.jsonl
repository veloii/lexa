We have carefully reviewed your request for a complete backyard renovation including patio installation, garden design, and irrigation system for $8,500. After conducting a preliminary site assessment based on your photos and specifications, we must respectfully decline this budget as it falls substantially below our cost requirements for this scope of work. Similar projects in your area typically range from $15,000-18,000 depending on material selections and site conditions. Quality hardscaping, professional-grade plants, and irrigation systems represent significant investments in materials and skilled labor. We would be pleased to work with you on a phased approach, beginning with essential elements within your budget, or explore alternative design options that could reduce costs while maintaining quality standards. Our team has 15 years of experience creating beautiful outdoor spaces, and we're committed to delivering exceptional results.
